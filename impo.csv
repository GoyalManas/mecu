"The Revolution of 1992 is about a radical change in the way government operates -",NA,"303",NA

"Its Director has dictatorial powers unique in the American Republic.",NA,"202.3",NA

"For a veteran, a job is more than a source of income.",NA,"701",NA

"We will retain the preference given to veterans when they seek federal employment.",NA,"706",NA
"We urge closer coordination with the state offices for veterans' affairs,",NA,"706",NA

"Instead of recognizing the danger and confronting it head-on, President Trump lied to the American people about the disease’s severity, its transmissibility, and the threat it posed to lives and livelihoods.",NA,"305.2",NA
"Make no mistake: President Trump’s abject failure to respond forcefully and capably to the COVID-19 pandemic—his failure to lead—makes him responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans.",NA,"305.2",NA
"COVID-19 has laid bare deep fault lines in our economy, our society, and our health care system.",NA,"602.1",NA
"Disparities in health care access, in access to paid sick leave, in environmental quality, in the employment market, and in housing have contributed to disproportionate rates of infection and death among Black Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and certain Asian American and Pacific Islander communities.",NA,"503",NA
"President Trump’s failure to pay attention to early intelligence reports about the pandemic wasted critical weeks in which we could have prepared for the outbreak.",NA,"305.2",NA
"Once the pandemic began spreading in the United States, the President’s failure to lay out clear, consistent guidelines for cities, states, businesses, and school districts to control the spread of COVID-19 created widespread confusion and chaos.",NA,"305.2",NA
"His reckless disregard for the advice of public health experts has made it harder for mayors and governors to protect the American people.",NA,"305.2",NA
"Rather than surge the production of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies where they were needed most, the Administration held life-saving resources hostage for political obeisance.",NA,"305.2",NA
"Instead of bringing Americans together, President Trump tried to divide us, using racist and xenophobic rhetoric that has contributed to an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.",NA,"503",NA
"And in the midst of the pandemic, the Trump Administration is arguing in court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act and rip health coverage away from tens of millions of people.",NA,"504",NA
"President Trump and his Administration have also failed to drive an economic response that is commensurate with the scale of the challenge before us,",NA,"409",NA
"preferring to act as though the recession caused by his incompetent mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic will correct itself.",NA,"409",NA
"He has hung small businesses out to dry while cutting blank checks to the largest corporations;",NA,"403",NA

"We will provide direct, increased support to states to enroll eligible adults in Medicaid,",NA,"504",NA
"have the federal government cover a higher percentage of the bill,",NA,"504",NA
"and add incentives for states which have not yet expanded Medicaid to do so.",NA,"504",NA
"For people who risk losing their insurance coverage if they lose their jobs in this pandemic and in President Trump’s recession, Democrats believe the federal government should pick up 100 percent of the tab for COBRA insurance, which keeps people on their employer-sponsored plans, without restrictions.",NA,"504",NA
"We will re-open the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, even outside of the normal open enrollment season, and expand subsidies to make it easier for people to buy health coverage.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats will also make available on the marketplace a public option administered through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) which includes a platinum-level choice, with low fees and no deductibles.",NA,"504",NA
"Low-income Americans will be automatically enrolled in the public option at zero cost to them, though they may choose to opt out at any time.",NA,"504",NA
"We will keep these emergency measures in place until the pandemic ends and unemployment falls significantly.",NA,"504",NA
"And should the United States find itself in another pandemic or severe economic downturn in the future, these protections will be made automatically available, so Americans are never again left to fend for themselves in times of crisis.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats are appalled that President Trump failed to act on the advice of Congress to maintain a strong stockpile of critical medical supplies, including personal protective equipment,",NA,"504",NA
"or adequately surge U.S. manufacturing of needed equipment through tools like the Defense Production Act.",NA,"504",NA
"The resulting equipment shortages endangered millions of lives, including those of our brave frontline health care workers and other essential workers.",NA,"504",NA
"Such shortages are unacceptable and must never happen again.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats will direct the federal government to work with private-sector manufacturers to dramatically scale up the United States’ domestic manufacturing capacity for both personal protective equipment and essential medicines.",NA,"504",NA
"We will restore federal leadership to ensure medical supplies are distributed according to need, not political favoritism,",NA,"504",NA
"and never put states in the position of having to compete against each other for life-saving materials.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats will aggressively enforce non-discrimination protections in the Americans with Disabilities Act and other civil rights laws,",NA,"503",NA
"especially when designing emergency management systems and new facilities and services in response to the pandemic.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats will prohibit unjustified segregation of patients with disabilities,",NA,"503",NA
"and additionally prohibit rationing of health care that refuses or diverts hospitalization, treatment, or supplies based on a patient’s disability.",NA,"503",NA
"We recognize people with disabilities living in group homes and other care facilities are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19,",NA,"503",NA
"and that people with disabilities may require additional resources to protect their health, well-being, and independence during the pandemic.",NA,"504",NA
"We will improve oversight and expand protections for residents and staff at nursing homes, which have seen some of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks.",NA,"504",NA
"And we will expand support for telemedicine, so Americans do not have to go without essential health care during the pandemic.",NA,"504",NA
"America must never again be left vulnerable to a global pandemic.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats believe we must follow the informed advice of scientists and public health experts,",NA,"305.1",NA

"Democrats will act swiftly to stand up a comprehensive, national public health surveillance program for COVID-19 and future infectious diseases.",NA,"504",NA
"We will recruit at least 100,000 contact tracers with support from trusted local organizations in the communities most at risk to help state and local health departments use culturally competent approaches to identify people at risk of contracting or spreading the coronavirus.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats believe we must reverse decades of underinvestment in America’s public health infrastructure.",NA,"504",NA
"We will substantially increase funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)",NA,"504",NA
"and for state and local public health departments, many of which suffered deep budget cuts during the Great Recession and are at risk of further cuts as a result of President Trump’s recession.",NA,"504",NA
"State and local public health departments should be given sufficient resources to address pandemic diseases and other public health crises through coordinated efforts",NA,"504",NA
"that are inclusive of underrepresented groups who may be disproportionately impacted.",NA,"503",NA

"Solving the public health crisis posed by the pandemic is the surest way to get the economy back on track.",NA,"408",NA
"Countries that have taken aggressive measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic and stop chains of infection from spreading are poised to have stronger, faster recoveries than the United States.",NA,"602.1",NA

"During acute economic downturns, Democrats believe that we must take care of our workforce and aim to keep workers whole.",NA,"701",NA

"For those workers who do lose their jobs, we will expand the unemployment insurance system to cover more workers, including independent contractors and gig, part-time, and tipped workers;",NA,"504",NA
"make sure platform companies and companies that misclassify employees as contractors pay in to support the system like other employers do",NA,"701",NA

"We will expand, not cut, nutrition assistance and food security programs that millions of Americans are relying on in this crisis.",NA,"504",NA
"Democrats will also make long-overdue investments to upgrade and modernize states’ unemployment system technology",NA,"303",NA

"To prevent President Trump’s recession from becoming a depression, Democrats believe we must act immediately to make ambitious investments that will support and create jobs.",NA,"701",NA
"We urgently need to support state and local governments, which are suffering severe budget shortfalls due to declines in tax revenues while being asked to shoulder the burden of COVID-related services and rising unemployment.",NA,"301",NA
"State and local budget cuts translate quickly into lost jobs in education, health care, and social services—all fields where we need to be adding jobs to meet the needs of the American people.",NA,"701",NA
"Democrats will extend significant aid to state and local governments,",NA,"301",NA

"As millions of Americans have stayed at home to prevent the spread of the pandemic, it is plain to see that in the 21st century, an accessible internet is not optional: it is a vital tool for receiving an education and for participating in the economy, and all Americans need access to high-speed, affordable broadband service.",NA,"411",NA
"Democrats will take action to prevent states from blocking municipalities and rural co-ops from building publicly-owned broadband networks,",NA,"411",NA

"our nation's economy has lost nearly $8 trillion of cumulative output compared with an average recovery,",NA,"410",NA

"Fair and Simple Taxes for Growth",NA,"H",NA
"Republicans consider the establishment of a pro-growth tax code a moral imperative.",NA,"410",NA
"More than any other public policy, the way government raises revenue — how much, at what rates, under what circumstances, from whom, and for whom — has the greatest impact on our economy's performance.",NA,"410",NA
"It powerfully influences the level of economic growth and job creation,",NA,"410",NA

"they should not be subject to taxation and donations to them should remain deductible.",NA,"603",NA
"To guard against hypertaxation of the American people in any restructuring of the federal tax system,",NA,"401",NA

"Private investment is a key driver of economic growth and job creation.",NA,"402",NA

"due in part to high corporate tax rates",NA,"402",NA
"and increasing regulatory burdens and uncertainty.",NA,"402",NA
"American businesses now face the world's highest corporate tax rates.",NA,"402",NA
"That's like putting lead shoes on your cross-country team.",NA,"402",NA
"It reduces companies' ability to compete overseas, encourages them to move abroad, lessens their investment,",NA,"402",NA
"cripples job creation here at home, lowers American wages,",NA,"701",NA
"and fosters the avoidance of tax liability",NA,"403",NA
"— without actually increasing tax revenues.",NA,"402",NA
"A more damaging policy is hard to imagine.",NA,"402",NA
"We propose to level the international playing field by lowering the corporate tax rate to be on a par with, or below, the rates of other industrial nations.",NA,"402",NA
"We endorse the recommendation of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, as well as the current Administration's Export Council, to switch to a territorial system of taxation  so that profits earned and taxed abroad may be repatriated for job-creating investment here at home.",NA,"402",NA

"We need better negotiated trade agreements that put America first.",NA,"406",NA
"When trade agreements have been carefully negotiated with friendly democracies, they have resulted in millions of new jobs here at home supported by our exports.",NA,"407",NA
"When those agreements do not adequately protect U.S. interests, U.S. sovereignty, or when they are violated with impunity, they must be rejected.",NA,"109",NA
"We cannot allow foreign governments to limit American access to their markets while stealing our designs, patents, brands, know-how, and technology.",NA,"109",NA

"Republicans understand that you can succeed in a negotiation only if you are willing to walk away from it.",NA,"109",NA
"A Republican president will insist on parity in trade",NA,"407",NA
"and stand ready to implement countervailing duties if other countries refuse to cooperate.",NA,"407",NA

"along with transparency in our commercial and business practices.",NA,"403",NA

"Unfortunately, in response to the financial institutions crisis of 2008-2009, the Democratic-controlled Congress enacted the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, otherwise known as Dodd-Frank.",NA,"401",NA
"They did not let the crisis go to waste but used it as an excuse to establish unprecedented government control over the nation's financial markets.",NA,"401",NA
"The consequences have been bad for everyone except federal regulators.",NA,"401",NA
"Rather than address the cause of the crisis — the government's own housing policies",NA,"305.1",NA
"— the new law extended government control over the economy by creating new unaccountable bureaucracies.",NA,"201.1",NA
"Predictably, central planning of our financial sector has not created jobs, it has killed them.",NA,"401",NA
"It has not limited risks, it has created more.",NA,"401",NA
"It has not encouraged economic growth, it has shackled it.",NA,"410",NA

"From 13,000 community banks in 1985, only 1,900 remain.",NA,"401",NA
"Still, the majority of agricultural loans and small business loans are made by community banks.",NA,"401",NA

"Community banks are essential to ensuring small businesses have easy and affordable access to the capital they need to grow and prosper.",NA,"401",NA
"Community banks should be relieved of excessive regulations.",NA,"401",NA
"We support removing roadblocks and regulations that prevent access to capital.",NA,"401",NA
"The worst of Dodd-Frank is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, deliberately designed to be a rogue agency.",NA,"401",NA
"It answers to neither Congress nor the executive,",NA,"202.3",NA
"has its own guaranteed funding outside the appropriations process,",NA,"202.3",NA
"and uses its slush fund to steer settlements to politically favored groups.",NA,"304",NA
"Its Director has dictatorial powers unique in the American Republic.",NA,"202.3",NA
"Its regulatory harassment of local and regional banks, the source of most home mortgages and small business loans, advantages big banks",NA,"401",NA
"and makes it harder for Americans to buy a home.",NA,"401",NA
"Its one-size-fits-all approach to every issue threatens the diversity of the country’s financial system",NA,"403",NA
"and would leave us with just a few enormous institutions, as in many European countries.",NA,"403",NA
"If the Bureau is not abolished, it should be subjected to congressional appropriation.",NA,"202.3",NA
"In that way, consumer protection in the financial markets can be advanced through measures that are both effective and constitutional.",NA,"403",NA
"Any settlements arising from statutory violations by financial institutions must be used to make whole the harmed consumers,",NA,"403",NA

"It means a decent place to live,",NA,"401",NA
"a safe place to raise kids,",NA,"603",NA

"U.S. taxpayers paid billions to rescue Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae,",NA,"403",NA
"the latter managed and controlled by senior officials from the Carter and Clinton Administrations,",NA,"305.1",NA

"Millions lost their homes, millions more lost value in their homes.",NA,"403",NA
"More than six million households had to move from homeownership to renting.",NA,"403",NA
"Rental costs escalated so that today nearly 12 million families spend more than 50 percent of their incomes just on rent.",NA,"403",NA
"The national homeownership rate has sharply fallen",NA,"403",NA
"and the rate for minority households and young adults has plummeted.",NA,"503",NA
"So many remain unemployed or underemployed,",NA,"701",NA
"and for the lucky ones with jobs, rising rents make it harder to save for a mortgage.",NA,"403",NA
"There is a growing sense that our national standard of living will never be as high as it was in the past.",NA,"410",NA
"We understand that pessimism but do not share it,",NA,"410",NA
"for we believe that sound public policies can restore growth to our economy, vigor to the housing market, and hope to those who are now on the margins of prosperity.",NA,"410",NA
"Our goal is to advance responsible home- ownership while guarding against the abuses that led to the housing collapse.",NA,"403",NA
"We must scale back the federal role in the housing market,",NA,"401",NA
"promote responsibility on the part of borrowers and lenders,",NA,"401",NA
"and avoid future taxpayer bailouts.",NA,"401",NA
"Reforms should provide clear and prudent underwriting standards and guidelines on predatory lending and acceptable lending practices.",NA,"403",NA
"Compliance with regulatory standards should constitute a legal safe harbor to guard against opportunistic litigation by trial lawyers.",NA,"403",NA
"We call for a comprehensive review of federal regulations,",NA,"401",NA
"especially those dealing with the environment,",NA,"401",NA
"that make it harder and more costly for Americans to rent, buy, or sell homes.",NA,"401",NA
"For nine years, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship and the current Administration and Democrats have prevented any effort to reform them.",NA,"305.1",NA
"Their corrupt business model lets shareholders and executives reap huge profits while the taxpayers cover all loses.",NA,"304",NA
"The utility of both agencies should be reconsidered as a Republican administration clears away the jumble of subsidies and controls that complicate and distort home-buying.",NA,"401",NA
"The Federal Housing Administration, which provides taxpayer-backed guarantees in the mortgage market, should no longer support high- income individuals,",NA,"403",NA

"We will end the government mandates that required Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and federally- insured banks to satisfy lending quotas to specific groups.",NA,"401",NA
"Discrimination should have no place in the mortgage industry.",NA,"503",NA
"Zoning decisions have always been, and must remain, under local control.",NA,"301",NA
"The current Administration is trying to seize control of the zoning process through its Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulation.",NA,"301",NA
"It threatens to undermine zoning laws in order to socially engineer every community in the country.",NA,"603",NA
"While the federal government has a legitimate role in enforcing non-discrimination laws,",NA,"503",NA
"this regulation has nothing to do with proven or alleged discrimination and everything to do with hostility to the self-government of citizens.",NA,"301",NA

"In the current Congress, Republicans have secured the longest reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund in a decade",NA,"411",NA
"and are advancing a comprehensive reform of the Federal Aviation Administration to make flying easier and more secure.",NA,"411",NA
"The current Administration has a different approach.",NA,"401",NA
"It subordinates civil engineering to social engineering as it pursues an exclusively urban vision of dense housing and government transit.",NA,"401",NA
"Its ill-named Livability Initiative is meant to “coerce people out of their cars.”",NA,"401",NA
"This is the same mentality that once led Congress to impose by fiat a single maximum speed limit for the entire nation, from Manhattan to Montana.",NA,"401",NA
"Our 1980 Republican Platform pledged to repeal that edict.",NA,"401",NA

"For a veteran, a job is more than a source of income.",NA,"701",NA

"We will retain the preference given to veterans when they seek federal employment.",NA,"706",NA

"We will remove barriers to help formerly incarcerated individuals successfully re-enter society by “banning the box,” expanding reentry programs, and restoring voting rights.",NA,"503",NA

"We will abolish the death penalty, which has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment.",NA,"605.2",NA
"It has no place in the United States of America.",NA,"605.2",NA
"The application of the death penalty is arbitrary and unjust.",NA,"503",NA
"The cost to taxpayers far exceeds those of life imprisonment.",NA,"303",NA
"It does not deter crime.",NA,"605.1",NA
"And, exonerations show a dangerous lack of reliability for what is an irreversible punishment.",NA,"605.2",NA

"Then-Senator Obama pledged during the 2008 campaign to responsibly end the war in Iraq, saying it was imperative to “be as careful getting out as we were careless getting in” – and that is precisely what he has done.",NA,"105",NA
"For over half a decade, our focus on Iraq meant we had taken our eye off of al-Qaeda,",NA,"104",NA

"including the danger posed by international terrorist organizations that threaten the American homeland.",NA,"104",NA
"As the Bush administration shifted its focus to Iraq, Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda established safe havens across the border from Afghanistan, in Pakistan.",NA,"104",NA
"President Obama’s decision to end the Iraq war freed up military and intelligence resources to refocus on this fight",NA,"105",NA

"Importantly, President Obama also shifted away from the Bush administration’s sweeping and internationally-divisive rhetoric of a “global war on terrorism”",NA,"107",NA
"to a more focused effort against an identifiable network of people: al-Qaeda and its affiliates.",NA,"107",NA

"As a candidate, then-Senator Obama committed to bringing Osama bin Laden to justice, even if that meant crossing the border into Pakistan.",NA,"104",NA
"As a consequence of the President’s decisions and the brave work of our military and intelligence professionals, bin Laden can no longer threaten the United States and al-Qaeda’s senior leadership has been devastated, rendering the group far less capable than it was four years ago.",NA,"104",NA
"The al-Qaeda core in Afghanistan and Pakistan has never been weaker.",NA,"104",NA
"We have also struck blows against al-Qaeda’s leadership in Yemen and Somalia – with the full support and close cooperation of those governments.",NA,"104",NA
"At the same time, the President and the Democratic Party understand that we must stay vigilant.",NA,"104",NA
"The al-Qaeda core may be on the path to defeat, but the organization and its affiliates remain active in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, and elsewhere.",NA,"104",NA
"For that reason, we are committed to an unrelenting pursuit of those who would kill Americans or threaten our homeland, our allies, our partners, and our interests around the world.",NA,"104",NA
"Responsibly Ending the War in Afghanistan",NA,NA,NA
"The United States went into Afghanistan after 9/11 to bring justice to those who had attacked us and to take away al-Qaeda’s safe haven.",NA,"104",NA
"But by the time President Obama took office, we had lost sight of those goals.",NA,"305",NA
"So the President refocused our efforts there in 2009, setting the clear goal of defeating al-Qaeda and denying it an ability to reestablish a safe haven in Afghanistan.",NA,"104",NA
"Because of the deteriorating security situation, he sent additional resources to reverse the Taliban’s momentum and to give the Afghans the time and space to build the capacity of their security forces.",NA,"104",NA
"We have accomplished that, and now we have begun the process of bringing our troops home from Afghanistan, including removing 33,000 by September 2012.",NA,"104",NA
"And, with the support of our allies, the President has outlined a plan to end the war in Afghanistan in 2014.",NA,"105",NA
"Already, the United States and our North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have begun to transition responsibility to Afghan security forces.",NA,"107",NA
"At the same time, we are keeping up the pressure on the Taliban,",NA,"104",NA
"pursuing the possibility of a political resolution to parts of the conflict,",NA,"107",NA

"Beyond 2014, we will continue to provide counterterrorism and training assistance and to build an enduring relationship with Afghanistan, as outlined by the U.S.-Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement concluded in May.",NA,"107",NA
"But we will not build permanent bases in Afghanistan.",NA,"105",NA
"More broadly, we will also continue to support peace and stability in South Asia.",NA,"106",NA
"Pakistan can be a partner in that process.",NA,"106",NA
"The United States will make clear that we respect Pakistan’s sovereignty and democratic institutions,",NA,"103",NA

"Mitt Romney has been both for and against our timeline to end the war in Afghanistan,",NA,"305",NA

"Preventing the Spread and Use of Nuclear Weapons",NA,NA,NA
"In our continuing efforts to keep America safe, President Obama and the Democratic Party believe we must address the threat that nuclear weapons pose to our security and to peace in the world.",NA,"104",NA
"Despite the two decades that have passed since the end of the Cold War, large stockpiles of nuclear weapons persist, and more nations are interested in acquiring them.",NA,"105",NA
"Nuclear testing and black-market trade in sensitive nuclear materials continue.",NA,"104",NA
"And terrorists remain determined to buy, build, or steal the ultimate weapon.",NA,"104",NA
"President Obama and the Democratic Party are committed to preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons",NA,"104",NA
"and to eventually ridding the planet of these catastrophic weapons.",NA,"104",NA
"This goal will not be achieved overnight.",NA,"104",NA
"It will require patience, perseverance, and the steady accumulation of concrete actions.",NA,"104",NA
"But real progress has already been made.",NA,"104",NA
"Reducing Nuclear Weapons Stockpiles. The Obama administration has moved away from Cold War thinking by reducing the prominence of nuclear weapons in America’s national security strategy, and it has urged others to do the same.",NA,"105",NA
"As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure, and effective arsenal to deter any adversary and guarantee the defense of our allies.",NA,"104",NA
"But President Obama has taken important steps to decrease America’s nuclear arsenal and is committed to further responsible reductions.",NA,"105",NA
"To reduce our warheads and stockpile, lower the threat of a nuclear exchange, and lay the foundation for future progress, President Obama negotiated and signed the landmark New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with Russia,",NA,"105",NA
"producing cuts in each side’s deployed nuclear stockpiles and launchers and allowing us to monitor and verify Russia’s arsenal.",NA,"105",NA
"Yet despite bipartisan consensus among former National Security Advisors, Secretaries of Defense, and Secretaries of State that New START makes America safer, Mitt Romney strongly objected to the treaty.",NA,"305",NA
"Moving forward, the President will work with Russia to achieve additional reductions in stockpiles and nuclear delivery vehicles, including tactical and non-deployed nuclear weapons.",NA,"105",NA
"We will also work to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty",NA,"105",NA
"and seek a new Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty that prohibits the production of fissile materials intended for use in nuclear weapons.",NA,"105",NA
"Preventing Nuclear Proliferation. President Obama and the Democratic Party are also committed to strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as the bedrock of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries.",NA,"107",NA
"As we work to uphold our obligations under the treaty by reducing stockpiles and recognizing the rights of all rule-abiding states to peaceful nuclear energy,",NA,"107",NA
"we will insist that countries without nuclear weapons comply with their obligations not to develop them,",NA,"107",NA
"and we will ensure that violators face real consequences.",NA,"104",NA
"Iran. President Obama, working closely with our international partners and Congress, has put in place unprecedented sanctions against Iran.",NA,"102",NA
"Iran has yet to build a nuclear weapon, but has continually failed to meet its obligations under the NPT and several United Nations Security Council resolutions,",NA,"107",NA
"and it cannot demonstrate with any credibility that its program is peaceful.",NA,"106",NA
"The President is committed to using all instruments of national power to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.",NA,"104",NA
"When President Obama took office, Iran was ascendant in the region, and the international community was divided over how to address Iran’s nuclear violations.",NA,"107",NA
"The President’s early offer of engagement with Iran – quickly rebuffed by the regime – allowed the United States to expose Iranian intransigence and rally the international community as never before.",NA,"107",NA
"Working with our European allies and with Russia and China, the administration gained unprecedented agreement for the toughest ever UN sanctions against Iran,",NA,"107",NA
"laying the foundation for additional national financial and energy sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations.",NA,"107",NA
"As a result, Iran is now increasingly isolated and the regime faces crippling economic pressure – pressure that will only build over time.",NA,"102",NA
"President Obama believes that a diplomatic outcome remains the best and most enduring solution.",NA,"107",NA
"At the same time, he has also made clear that the window for diplomacy will not remain open indefinitely and that all options – including military force – remain on the table.",NA,"104",NA
"But we have an obligation to use the time and space that exists now to put increasing pressure on the Iranian regime to live up to its obligations and rejoin the community of nations, or face the consequences.",NA,"107",NA
"North Korea. President Obama will also continue to confront North Korea, another regime that ignores its international obligations by developing nuclear weapons and missile technology, with a stark choice: take verifiable steps toward denuclearization",NA,"107",NA
"or face increasing isolation and costs from the United States and the international community.",NA,"107",NA
"That is why the administration worked with international partners to impose the harshest multilateral sanctions on North Korea in history.",NA,"107",NA
"And it is why the President has made clear that the transfer of nuclear weapons or material by North Korea to states or non-state entities would be considered a grave threat to the United States and our allies, and we would hold North Korea accountable for the consequences of such action.",NA,"107",NA
"Securing Loose Nuclear Materials. The President has led a global effort to secure all loose nuclear materials around the world,",NA,"107",NA
"hosting a nuclear security summit in Washington,",NA,"107",NA
"and making concrete progress in locking these materials down.",NA,"107",NA
"This is an important goal because the prospect that al-Qaeda or another terrorist organization might acquire a nuclear device represents an immediate and extreme threat to global security.",NA,"107",NA
"At the same time, the United States will continue to work with international partners to break up black markets,",NA,"107",NA
"detect and intercept nuclear materials in transit,",NA,"107",NA
"and use financial tools to disrupt this dangerous trade.",NA,"107",NA
"Russia. Crucial to achieving all of these objectives has been, and will remain, expanded cooperation with Russia.",NA,"107",NA
"The Cold War mentality represented by Mitt Romney’s identification of Russia as “our number one geopolitical foe” ignores the very real common interest we share with Russia in reducing nuclear stockpiles,",NA,"107",NA
"stopping additional proliferation by countries such as Iran and North Korea,",NA,"107",NA
"and preventing nuclear materials from falling into the hands of terrorists.",NA,"107",NA
"The President’s “reset” policy toward Russia has produced significant cooperation in these areas, as well as in Russian support for the Northern Distribution Network that supplies our troops in Afghanistan.",NA,"107",NA
"We support establishing permanent, normal trade relations with Russia because it would be good for the U.S. economy, for U.S. businesses, and for U.S. workers if we do.",NA,"107",NA
"And securing Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organization is an important step toward encouraging Russia to follow a rules-based system",NA,"107",NA
", and to protecting the rights of American workers, farmers, ranchers, and firms.",NA,"107",NA
"At the same time, we are candid with the Russians when we disagree.",NA,"000",NA
"The administration will not put aside our differences but will raise them directly with the Russian government.",NA,"107",NA

"Countering Emerging Threats",NA,NA,NA

"Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity threats represent one of the most serious potential national security, public safety, and economic challenges we face.",NA,"104",NA
"The very technologies that empower us to lead and create also empower individual criminal hackers, organized criminal groups, terrorist networks, and other advanced nations to disrupt the critical infrastructure that is vital to our economy, commerce, public safety, and military.",NA,"104",NA
"Defending against cyber threats requires networks that are secure, trustworthy, and resilient.",NA,"104",NA

"And, going forward, the President will continue to take executive action to strengthen and update our cyber defenses.",NA,"104",NA
"Biological Weapons. Other dangers pose direct and deadly risks to our health and well-being.",NA,"104",NA
"The use of a lethal biological agent within a population center would threaten the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.",NA,"104",NA
"That’s why President Obama outlined a National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats in 2009 to address the challenges from proliferation of biological weapons or their use by terrorists.",NA,"104",NA
"We will continue to work at home with first responders and health officials to reduce the risks associated with unintentional or deliberate outbreaks of infectious disease.",NA,"104",NA
"We will also continue our efforts with domestic and international partners to promote global health security and reinforce norms of safe and responsible conduct; obtain timely and accurate insight on current and emerging risks; take steps to reduce the potential for exploitation; expand our capability to prevent, attribute, and apprehend perpetrators of attacks;  and communicate with all stakeholders.",NA,"107",NA

"The entrenched culture of official Washington — an intrusive tax-and-spend liberalism — remains a formidable foe, but we will confront and ultimately defeat it.",NA,"408",NA
"Washington’s Failure: the Scope of the Problem",NA,NA,NA
"The federal government collects $2.7 trillion a year from American families and businesses.",NA,"305",NA
"That's $7.4 billion a day.",NA,"305",NA
"Even worse, it spends over $3 trillion a year: $8.2 billion a day.",NA,"305",NA
"Why? Largely because those who created this bloated government will not admit a single mistake or abolish a single program.",NA,"305",NA
"Here are some staggering examples of the overall problem: * Recent audits show that 22% of all federal programs are ineffective or incapable of demonstrating results. * 69 separate programs, administered by 10 different agencies, provide education or care to children under the age of 5. * Nine separate agencies administer 44 different programs for job training.   • 23 separate programs, each with its own overhead, provide housing assistance to the elderly.",NA,"305",NA
"With so many redundant, inefficient, and ineffective federal programs, it is no wonder that the American people have so little confidence in Washington to act effectively when federal action is really needed.",NA,"305",NA
"The Budget Process — A Fraud that Guarantees Runaway Spending",NA,NA,NA
"For more than three decades — since enactment of the Budget Act of 1974 by a Democrat-controlled Congress — the federal government has operated within a rigged system notable for its lack of transparency.",NA,"305",NA
"The earlier approach — annual passage of the appropriation bills, amended and voted up or down, with the numbers there for all to see — had its flaws and generated much red ink.",NA,"305",NA
"But its replacement, the current budget process, only worsened the money flow and came to rely on monstrous omnibus spending bills.",NA,"305",NA
"The results are adverse to all seeking to limit government's growth.",NA,"305",NA
"For example: * The budget process assumes every spending project will be on the books forever, even if the law says the spending will expire — but it assumes tax relief will be temporary. * It treats well-deserved tax cuts as a kind of spending, so that letting Americans keep more of their earnings is considered the same as more spending on pork projects. * It fails to recognize the positive impact that lowering tax rates has on economic growth. * In its deceptive and irresponsible accounting, an increase in a program's funding is actually a decrease if it is less than the rate of inflation. * Once a budget is produced under that sys tem, the budget law itself limits the time Congress can consider it before voting.",NA,"305",NA
"Moreover, the budget's review process is a sham.",NA,"305",NA
"Of the $3 trillion spent annually, only one-third is reviewed each year during the budget and appropriations process. The remaining $2 trillion automatically goes to interest on the national debt or entitlements.",NA,"305",NA
"And because the budget process assumes an automatic increase in spending, the debate on the remaining one-third is only over how much more spending to approve.",NA,"305",NA
"Finally, while government requires corporations to budget for future pension and health care costs, our government ignores those requirements.",NA,"305",NA

"* Government waste must be taken off autopilot.",NA,"408",NA
"We call for a one-year pause in nondefense, non-veterans discretionary spend   ing to force a critical, cost-benefit review of all current programs.",NA,"408",NA
"* We call for a constitutionally sound presidential line-item veto.",NA,"203",NA
"* If billions are worth spending, they should be spent in the light of day.",NA,"408",NA
"We will insist that, before either the House or Senate considers a spending bill, every item in it should be presented in advance to the taxpayers on the Internet.",NA,"408",NA
"* Because the problem is too much spending, not too few taxes, we support a supermajority requirement in both the House and Senate to guard against tax hikes.",NA,"408",NA
"* New authorizations should be offset by reducing another program, and no appropriation should be permitted without a current authorization.",NA,"414",NA
"* Congressional ethics rules governing special interests should apply across the board, without the special exemptions now granted to favored institutions.",NA,"408",NA
"* We support the Government Shutdown Protection Act to ensure the continuance of essential federal functions when advocates of pork threaten to shut down the government unless their wasteful spending is accepted.",NA,"414",NA

"We look to the model of Republican welfare reform, which, since its enactment in 1996, has accomplished a major transfer of resources and responsibility from the federal government back to the states — with an accompanying improvement in the program itself.",NA,"301",NA
"Applying that approach to other programs will steer Congress back into line with the Constitution, reversing both its intrusion into state matters and its neglect of its central duties.",NA,"203",NA
"To aid in the fulfillment of those duties, we propose a National Sunset Commission to review all federal programs and recommend which of them should be terminated due to redundancy, waste, or intrusion into the American family.",NA,"303",NA
"The Congress would then be required by law to schedule one yea or nay vote on the entire sunset list with no amendments.",NA,"303",NA
"Additionally, as important as returning power to the states is returning power to the people.",NA,"301",NA

"Congress has a fundamental duty to conduct meaningful oversight on the effectiveness of government programs, not use every hearing as an opportunity for political grandstanding.",NA,"303",NA
"To that end:  • We urge every congressional committee to reserve at least one week every month to conduct oversight of the nearly 1,700 separate grant and loan programs of the federal government.",NA,"303",NA
"* To prevent conflicts of interest, a Truth in Testimony mandate should require all committee witnesses to detail the amount of federal funding they and their employer currently receive and, in the case of associations, how much federal money their members would receive from the proposed legislation.",NA,"303",NA

"The President continues to lead a steady, confident, systematic campaign to defend America against the dangers of our time.",NA,"605",NA
"We are going after terrorists wherever they plot and plan and hide, changing the old course of pinprick strikes that did little to get at the root of terrorism.",NA,"605",NA
"We eliminated many of al Qaeda's key leaders and put the world on notice that nations that train, harbor, or finance terrorists are just as guilty as the terrorists themselves.",NA,"605",NA
"We will not allow the world's most dangerous regimes to possess the world's most dangerous weapons.",NA,"605",NA
"Our message is getting through, as indicated by Libya's leader, who decided to turn over his weapons of mass destruction and cooperate with the international community.",NA,"605",NA

"On September 11, 2001, we saw the cruelty of the terrorists, and we glimpsed the future they intend for us.",NA,"605",NA
"They intend to strike the United States to the limits of their power.",NA,"605",NA

"The President's most solemn duty is to protect our country.",NA,"305",NA

"He worked with Congress to establish the Department of Homeland Security in the most significant reorganization of the federal government since 1947.",NA,"305",NA
"The PATRIOT Act is being used to track terrorist activity and to break up terror cells.",NA,"605",NA
"Now, the FBI can use tools that have been long available to fight organized crime and drug trafficking, but could not be used in the past to fight terrorism.",NA,"605",NA
"Intelligence and law enforcement officials are sharing information as never before.",NA,"605",NA
"The President transformed the mission of the FBI to focus first and foremost on preventing terrorism.",NA,"605",NA

"Before entering office, President Bush recognized that our age is a time of opportunity for America - opportunity to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty.",NA,"107",NA
"That conviction is in the finest traditions of the Republican Party.",NA,"107",NA
"As our platform said in 1984, during the height of Cold War confrontation: ""The supreme purpose of our foreign policy must be to maintain our freedom in a peaceful international environment in which the United States and our allies and friends are secure against military threats, and democratic governments are flourishing in a world of increasing prosperity.”",NA,"107",NA

"• Terrorists long ago declared war on America, and now America has declared war against terrorists.",NA,"104",NA
"We are defending the peace by taking the fight to the enemy.",NA,"104",NA
"We are confronting terrorists overseas so we do not have to confront them here at home.",NA,"104",NA
"We are destroying the leadership of terrorist networks in sudden raids, disrupting their planning and financing, and keeping them on the run.",NA,"104",NA
"Month by month, we are shrinking the space in which they can freely operate, by denying them territory and the support of governments.",NA,"104",NA
"•Nations that support terrorism are just as dangerous, and just as guilty, as the perpetrators of terrorism.",NA,"101",NA
"Every nation must make a choice to support terror or to support America and our coalition to defeat terror.",NA,"101",NA
"We are preserving the peace by working with more than 80 allied nations, as well as international institutions, to isolate and confront terrorists and outlaw regimes.",NA,"101",NA
"America is leading a broad coalition of nations to disrupt proliferation.",NA,"107",NA
"We are working with the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international organizations to take action in our common security.",NA,"107",NA
"The global threat of terrorism requires a global response.",NA,"104",NA
"To be effective, that global response requires leadership - and America is leading.",NA,"104",NA
"•There is no negotiation with terrorists.",NA,"202",NA
"No form of therapy or coercion will turn them from their murderous ways.",NA,"202",NA
"Only total and complete destruction of terrorism will allow freedom to flourish.",NA,"202",NA
"We will extend the peace by supporting the rise of democracy, and the hope and progress that democracy brings, as the alternative to hatred and terror in the broader Middle East.",NA,"202",NA
"In democratic societies, men and women do not swear allegiance to malcontents and murderers; they turn their hearts and labor to building better lives.",NA,"202",NA
"Democratic governments do not shelter terrorist camps or attack their neighbors.",NA,"202",NA
"When justice and democracy advance, so does the hope of lasting peace.",NA,"202",NA
"We are proud of the President's steady leadership in executing this strategy.",NA,"305",NA
"We are dealing with terrorist threats as they gather, rather than waiting for them to become imminent dangers.",NA,"305",NA
"The results are clear to see.",NA,"305",NA
"•Three years ago, our nation was not on a war footing against al Qaeda - even though Osama bin Laden declared war on the United States in 1996 and again in 1998.",NA,"605",NA
"The al Qaeda leadership believed itself to be impervious to any American response, continued to raise funds practically without restriction, and operated in a world in which there was no cohesive global approach to fighting terror.",NA,"605",NA
"Today, al Qaeda has been wounded, having lost many of its known leaders and most of its important sanctuaries.",NA,"605",NA
"America and its allies and friends have broken al Qaeda cells here in the United States and overseas.",NA,"605",NA

"•Three years ago, al Qaeda's secure home base was in Afghanistan, a country ruled by the Taliban, one of the most backward and brutal regimes of modern history.",NA,"605",NA
"Schooling was denied to girls.",NA,"605",NA
"Women were whipped and executed in public.",NA,"605",NA
"Millions lived in fear.",NA,"605",NA
"With protection from the Taliban, al Qaeda and its associates trained, indoctrinated, and sent forth thousands of killers to set up terror cells in dozens of countries, including our own.",NA,"605",NA

"Many refugees have returned home to rebuild their country, and a presidential election is scheduled for this fall.",NA,"201",NA

"Today, because we acted to liberate Afghanistan, a threat has been removed, and the American people are safer.",NA,"605",NA
"•Three years ago, Pakistan was one of the few countries in the world that recognized the Taliban regime.",NA,"102",NA
"Al Qaeda was active and recruiting in Pakistan.",NA,"102",NA
"Pakistan served as a transit point for al Qaeda terrorists leaving Afghanistan on missions of murder.",NA,"102",NA
"The United States could not count on the support of Pakistan's military and civilian leaders - the very people we would need to help shut down al Qaeda operations in that part of the world.",NA,"102",NA

"•Three years ago, terrorists were well-established in Saudi Arabia.",NA,"102",NA
"Inside that country, fundraisers and other facilitators gave al Qaeda financial and logistical help with little scrutiny or opposition.",NA,"102",NA
"Today, after the attacks in Riyadh and elsewhere, the Saudi government knows that al Qaeda is its enemy.",NA,"101",NA
"Saudi Arabia is working hard to shut down the facilitators and financial supporters of terrorism.",NA,"101",NA
"The government has captured or killed many first-tier leaders of the al Qaeda organization in Saudi Arabia.",NA,"101",NA
"Today, because Saudi Arabia has seen the danger and has joined the War on Terror, the American people are safer.",NA,"101",NA
"•Three years ago, the ruler of Iraq was a sworn enemy of America who provided safe haven for terrorists, used weapons of mass destruction, and turned his nation into a prison.",NA,"102",NA
"Saddam Hussein was not just a dictator; he was a proven mass murderer who refused to account for weapons of mass murder.",NA,"102",NA
"He defied the international community and seventeen United Nations resolutions over the course of twelve years, giving no indication that Iraq would ever disarm and comply with the just demands of the world.",NA,"102",NA
"In 2002 - in Resolution 1441 - the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted that Saddam Hussein had one final chance to comply with his obligations to the international community, or there would be serious consequences.",NA,"102",NA
"As he had for over a decade, he refused to comply.",NA,"102",NA
"Every responsible nation recognized this threat, and knew it could not go on forever.",NA,"102",NA

"Iraq, which once had the worst government in the Middle East, is now becoming an example of reform to the region.",NA,"605",NA
"Iraqi security forces are fighting beside coalition troops to defeat the terrorists and foreign fighters who threaten their nation and the world.",NA,"605",NA
"Today, because America and our coalition helped to end the violent regime of Saddam Hussein, and because we are helping to raise a peaceful democracy in its place, 25 million Iraqis are free and the American people are safer.",NA,"605",NA
"•Three years ago, the nation of Libya, a longtime supporter of terror, was spending millions to acquire chemical and nuclear weapons.",NA,"102",NA
"Today, thousands of Libya's chemical munitions have been destroyed.",NA,"101",NA
"Libya's nuclear equipment that could ultimately have threatened the lives of hundreds of thousands is stored away in the United States.",NA,"101",NA
"Today, because the Libyan government saw the seriousness of the civilized world, and correctly judged its own interests, the American people are safer.",NA,"101",NA
"•Three years ago, a private weapons proliferation network was doing business around the world.",NA,"605",NA
"This network, operated by the Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, was selling nuclear plans and equipment to the highest bidder, and found willing buyers in places like Libya, Iran, and North Korea.",NA,"605",NA
"Today, the A.Q. Khan network is out of business.",NA,"605",NA
"We have ended one of the most dangerous sources of proliferation in the world, and the American people are safer.",NA,"605",NA

"The success of free and stable governments in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere will further shrink the space in which terrorists can operate.",NA,"605",NA
"As the entire region sees the promise of freedom in its midst, the terrorist ideology will become more and more irrelevant, until that day when it is viewed with contempt or ignored altogether.",NA,"605",NA
"The forces of many nations are working with Afghans to find and defeat Taliban remnants and eliminate al Qaeda terrorists.",NA,"104",NA
"We applaud the work of American forces and coalition partners in helping to build the new Afghan national army and to train new Afghan police and border patrol.",NA,"104",NA
"Together, Afghan and international forces will maintain the peace, secure Afghanistan's borders, and deny terrorists any foothold in that country.",NA,"104",NA

"As Republicans, we do not equivocate, as others have done, about whether America should have gone to war in Iraq.",NA,"104",NA
"The best intelligence available at the time indicated that Saddam Hussein was a threat.",NA,"104",NA
"On that point, President Bush, members of both parties in Congress, and the United Nations agreed.",NA,"104",NA
"While the stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction we expected to find in Iraq have not yet materialized, we have confirmed that Saddam Hussein had the capability to reconstitute his weapons programs and the desire to do so.",NA,"104",NA
"Our nation did the right thing, and the American people are now safer because we and our allies ended the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, halting his decades-long pursuit of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.",NA,"104",NA
"President Bush had a choice to make: Trust a madman or defend America.",NA,"104",NA
"He chose defending America.",NA,"104",NA
"Supported by brave coalition allies such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, Poland, and Denmark,",NA,"101",NA
"and displaying courage, skill, and resourcefulness on the battlefield, the men and women of our Armed Forces removed the dictator of Iraq, a declared enemy of America who had the capability and intent to produce weapons of mass murder, and could have passed that capability to terrorists bent on killing Americans.",NA,"104",NA
"That was a risk we could not take.",NA,"104",NA
"America's men and women in uniform have been unrelenting in the performance of their duty.",NA,"104",NA

"Their efforts with us to shape a world where freedom is honored and liberty is cherished deserves respect and admiration; their sacrifice, too, does not go without notice and appreciation.",NA,"101",NA
"We are ever mindful that American troops remain on the ground in Iraq, working steadfastly to help the Iraqi people achieve stability and democracy.",NA,"104",NA

"•Phased-out the death tax that punishes family-owned small businesses and family farms.",NA,"402",NA

"In 2000 we rightly declared: ""The federal tax code is dysfunctional.",NA,"402",NA
"It penalizes hard work, marriage, thrift, and success - the very factors that are the foundations for lasting prosperity.",NA,"402",NA
""" As noted earlier, from reducing marginal income tax rates to phasing out the death tax, President Bush and the Republican Congress have made great strides in addressing each of these problems.",NA,"402",NA
"However, it is equally obvious that much more remains to be done to reform the federal tax code.",NA,"402",NA
"Instead of being simple, the current tax system is needlessly complex, making it susceptible to abusive tax avoidance schemes.",NA,"404",NA
"Instead of being efficient, it punishes hard work, discourages savings and investment, and hinders the international competitiveness of U.S. firms.",NA,"404",NA
"Instead of being fair, it is out of line with our basic values and undermines our sense of fairness.",NA,"404",NA
"Instead of being predictable, it is highly unpredictable and uncertain.",NA,"404",NA
"Tax reform is necessary to achieve the simplicity, efficiency, fairness, and predictability that the American people deserve, and to give all Americans the freedom to determine their own spending priorities.",NA,"404",NA
"In particular, we must:",NA,NA,NA
"•Make the tax relief of 2001 and 2003 permanent.",NA,"402",NA
"The various expiring tax relief provisions, ranging from 2005 to 2011, make the tax code confusing for everybody and limits the ability of workers, families, and businesses to plan for the future with confidence.",NA,"402",NA
"Nowhere is this more apparent than with the death tax, which is reduced now, disappears in 2010, and then comes fully back to life in 2011.",NA,"402",NA

"• Replace the tax code with a system that is simpler, provides more freedom to our citizens, is pro-growth, boosts the economy, and encourages savings and investment.",NA,"303",NA

"Because of the vital role of religious and fraternal benevolent societies in fostering charity and patriotism, they should not be subject to taxation.",NA,"706",NA
"Alternative Minimum Tax",NA,NA,NA
"The alternative minimum tax (AMT) represents a second tax system for individuals.",NA,"303",NA
"Its stated goal is to insure that high-income taxpayers pay some amount of income tax.",NA,"303",NA
"But due to the lack of indexing, the broad base and reach of the current AMT will make it apply increasingly to middle-income taxpayers.",NA,"303",NA
"Millions of additional taxpayers must complete AMT forms just to determine that they are not subject to the tax.",NA,"303",NA
"As we look at the broader issue of tax reform, we call upon Congress to address this increasingly unfair second tax system on hardworking Americans.",NA,"303",NA
"Fiscal Discipline and Government Reform",NA,NA,NA
"To make sure the private sector has the capital it needs to invest, grow the economy, and expand prosperity, our leaders must make sure that the growth of the federal government remains in check.",NA,"404",NA
"The challenges America has faced over the last four years have created an unwelcome but manageable budget deficit.",NA,"404",NA
"These deficits are due to a number of factors: the stock market downturn that began in 2000 and the subsequent recession that President Bush inherited when he took office; the terrorist attacks on America and the necessary spending for homeland security and the War on Terror those attacks precipitated; and the crisis in confidence produced by corporate scandals that were years in the making.",NA,"404",NA
"It is important to view the size of the deficit in relation to the size of the nation's economy.",NA,"404",NA
"By that measure, today's deficit, although unwelcome, is well within historical ranges.",NA,"404",NA
"A deficit that is 3. 8 percent of GDP, as is now projected for this year, would be smaller than the deficits in nine of the last 25 years, and far below the peak deficit figure of 6 percent of GDP reached in 1983.",NA,"404",NA
"This deficit is also in line with what other industrialized nations are facing today.",NA,"404",NA
"The U. S. deficit matches the average deficit within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and is below the levels of France, Germany, and Japan.",NA,"404",NA
"Much more importantly, because the President and Congress enacted pro-growth economic policies, the deficit is headed strongly in the right direction.",NA,"404",NA
"Next year's projected deficit, at 2. 7 percent of GDP, would be smaller than those in 14 of the last 25 years.",NA,"404",NA
"As Republicans in Congress work with the President to restrain spending and strengthen economic growth, the federal deficit will fall to 1. 5 percent of the nation's economic output in 2009 - well below the 2. 2 percent average of the last 40 years.",NA,"404",NA
"The events that brought us into deficit are not completely behind us.",NA,"404",NA
"The War on Terror goes on.",NA,"404",NA

"Republicans are committed to winning the War on Terror and will continue to implement policies that promote jobs, investment, and growth in every region of the country and every sector of our economy.",NA,"404",NA
"Let us be clear: If government is to meet the most pressing needs of our time and still maintain fiscal discipline, government leaders must set priorities and stick with them.",NA,"404",NA
"President Bush has shown genuine leadership in doing just that.",NA,"404",NA
"Time and again, he has made difficult decisions and followed through with clear determination.",NA,"404",NA
"He has made it plain that his top budgetary priority is to protect America and win the War on Terror.",NA,"404",NA
"He also remains committed to the education reforms he spearheaded in 2001.",NA,"404",NA
"All discretionary spending must be kept in check and taxes must remain low to stimulate economic growth.",NA,"404",NA
"We endorse the President's pro-growth economic policies and his disciplined approach to spending taxpayers' dollars.",NA,"404",NA

"New spending requires the government to take control of a bigger slice of the economy.",NA,"404",NA
"We recognize that the problem is not that the American people are taxed too little but that the federal government spends too much.",NA,"404",NA
"To ensure that the federal government respects the burdens on taxpayers and spends only as much as is necessary to accomplish our common goals, we support extending the pay-as-you-go requirement for mandatory spending only.",NA,"404",NA
"Limiting Spending Growth",NA,NA,NA
"Spending limits will help Congress restrain the growth of government.",NA,"404",NA
"We support a cap on discretionary spending that will limit the growth of overall spending while ensuring that priorities such as our nation's security will continue to be met.",NA,"404",NA
"We applaud President Bush for submitting a budget for 2005 that provides significant increases in funding to win the War on Terror and protect the homeland, while limiting the growth in all other non-security related discretionary spending to less than one percent.",NA,"404",NA
"Line-Item Veto",NA,NA,NA
"To further the goal of respecting taxpayers' dollars and restraining spending, we endorse the creation of a line-item veto, which the President could use consistent with the Constitution to reject new appropriations, new mandatory spending, or limited grants of tax benefits (to 100 or fewer beneficiaries) whenever he determines the spending or tax benefits are not essential priorities.",NA,"404",NA
"Under this approach, all savings from the line-item veto would be used for deficit reduction, and could not be applied to other spending.",NA,"404",NA
"Governors across the nation already have and use this tool to reduce unnecessary spending.",NA,"404",NA
"The President should have the same option.",NA,"404",NA
"Sunset Commission",NA,NA,NA
"It is often said that a government program is the closest man has come to achieving immortality.",NA,"303",NA
"Government programs are designed with specific purposes, and they ought to be assessed to determine whether they are meeting their goals.",NA,"303",NA
"We endorse creating a commission to evaluate discretionary spending on federal agencies and programs to ensure that taxpayer funds are being used for the best, most efficient purposes.",NA,"303",NA
"Such a commission would determine whether certain programs are duplicative, wasteful or inefficient, outdated or irrelevant, or failed.",NA,"303",NA
"It would recommend to Congress programs that could be terminated, moved, or restructured to make the government more efficient.",NA,"303",NA
"Management Agenda",NA,NA,NA
"New government programs are frequently created with little review of programs that already exist to address the same perceived problem.",NA,"303",NA
"Over time, numerous programs with overlapping missions and competing agendas grow up alongside one another - wasting money and baffling citizens.",NA,"303",NA
"We support President Bush's vision for government reform, which is guided by three principles.",NA,"303",NA
"Government should be: citizen-centered, not bureaucracy-centered; results-oriented; and market-based, actively promoting rather than stifling innovation through competition.",NA,"303",NA
"The President's management agenda is an effective tool for making sure government is active but limited, focusing on results and obtaining them efficiently.",NA,"303",NA
"Corporate Accountability",NA,NA,NA

"The private sector functions most effectively when laws are transparent and people respect them - this includes people in positions of power.",NA,"305",NA
"When corporate leaders break the law, they should be punished.",NA,"305",NA
"After fraudulent corporate practices rooted in the irrational exuberance of the late 1990s began to surface in the closing months of 2001, President Bush worked with the Congress to take decisive action to restore honesty and integrity to America's corporate boardrooms.",NA,"605",NA
"In July 2002, President Bush signed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the most farreaching reform of American business practices since the 1940s.",NA,"605",NA
"Under this new law, CEOs and Chief Financial Officers are required to personally vouch for the truth and fairness of their companies' disclosures; for the first time, an independent board has been established to oversee the accounting profession; investigators have been given new tools to root out corporate fraud; and enhanced penalties are ensuring that dishonest corporate officials do hard time.",NA,"605",NA
"We applaud President Bush for vigorously enforcing the law to deter and punish further corporate abuses.",NA,"603",NA
"He established an interagency Corporate Fraud Task Force to investigate and prosecute financial crimes; to recover the proceeds of those crimes; and to hold corporate criminals to account.",NA,"603",NA
"Since the Task Force was established two years ago, over 700 violators have been charged and over 300 convictions or guilty pleas secured, including more than 25 former CEOs.",NA,"605",NA
"More than $1 billion in forfeited funds has also been recovered from corporate wrongdoers for return to defrauded creditors and investors.",NA,"605",NA
"Separately, the enforcement budget of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has more than doubled, and the SEC has issued new rules to ban latetrading and other fraudulent practices engaged in by certain mutual funds.",NA,"605",NA

"•The Administration has also made significant progress in negotiating multi-lateral trade agreements, having just last month revived World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations for the final phase of the Doha round.",NA,"401",NA

"Injured persons on average collect less than 50 cents of every dollar that the legal system costs.",NA,"402",NA
"Trial lawyers get rich from the misfortune of others.",NA,"402",NA
"If small business is America's economic engine, trial lawyers are the brakes: They cost hundreds of thousands of good jobs, drive honest employers out of business, deprive women of critical medical care - then skip out with fat wallets and nary a thought for the economic havoc and human misery they leave in their wake.",NA,"402",NA
"We praise President Bush and Republicans in Congress for their efforts to reform the legal system by passing meaningful class action reform, asbestos reform, and medical liability reform.",NA,"402",NA
"And we call to account Senate Democrats and the powerful trial lawyer lobby, who have shown no shame in utilizing obstructionist tactics to thwart the efforts of majorities in Congress to provide meaningful relief to all Americans.",NA,"402",NA

"Republicans support a healthy intercity passenger rail system.",NA,"411",NA
"Amtrak provides a valuable service to passengers, especially in the Northeast corridor.",NA,"411",NA

"Clearly the financial problems plaguing Amtrak cannot be solved simply by continued infusions of taxpayer dollars.",NA,"411",NA

"We need a comprehensive energy policy so that we will no longer lurch from one energy crisis to the next.",NA,"411",NA

"New technologies will allow us to create new job-producing industries and save jobs in industries that have long been staples of America's economy.",NA,"411",NA
"For instance, working with Congressional Republicans, the President has already committed $2 billion over 10 years for clean coal research and development - which helps keep America's coal industry strong and reduces the emissions associated with coal use.",NA,"411",NA

"The drilling footprint can be confined to just 2,000 acres (the entire refuge contains 19 million acres), about the size of Washington's Dulles Airport, on ice roads that melt away in the summer, leaving little trace of human intervention.",NA,"411",NA
"We have already wasted precious time.",NA,"411",NA
"If the previous Administration had not vetoed the ANWR proposal passed by the Republican Congress in 1995, at this moment ANWR would be producing up to one million barrels of oil a day.",NA,"411",NA
"• Republicans strongly support removing unnecessary barriers to domestic natural gas production and expanding environmentally sound production in new areas, such as Alaska and the Rocky Mountains.",NA,"411",NA

"Every child deserves a first-rate education, because every child holds infinite potential, and we should give them every opportunity to reach it.",NA,"506",NA
"We believe there is an inseparable link between a vibrant economy and a highquality education system.",NA,"506",NA

"Equally, it takes a quality education system to provide the highly skilled labor force necessary to meet the demands of a growing, vibrant economy.",NA,"506",NA
"Strong schools will also produce a workforce with the skills to compete in the 21st century economy.",NA,"506",NA
"We must have citizens capable of conceiving the next generation of new technologies and innovations, mastering the art of analyzing problems and crafting their solutions.",NA,"506",NA
"Education is the key to prosperity and fulfillment - the foundation on which all other success is built.",NA,"506",NA

"Less than a year later, he secured an overwhelming bipartisan majority to pass the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.",NA,"506",NA
"It was the most significant overhaul of federal education policy since 1965.",NA,"506",NA
"And it became a promise kept to parents, students, teachers, and every American.",NA,"506",NA
"The law is based on four fundamental pillars:",NA,NA,NA

"Local Control",NA,NA,NA
"We recognize that under the American Constitutional system, education is a state, local, and family responsibility, not a federal obligation.",NA,"301",NA
"Since over 90 percent of public school funding is state and local, not federal, it is obvious that state and local governments must assume most of the responsibility to improve the schools, and the role of the federal government must be limited as we return control to parents, teachers, and local school boards.",NA,"301",NA

"The President and Republicans in Congress recognize that states and local communities are most directly responsible for the quality of education in their schools.",NA,"506",NA
"That is why the No Child Left Behind Act stipulates that the states, not the federal government, develop an accountability plan that will work best for them.",NA,"506",NA

"High School Education",NA,NA,NA

"These needed reforms are backed by historic levels of funding for teacher quality initiatives and support for teachers, including training, recruitment incentives, loan forgiveness, and tax relief.",NA,"506",NA
"We must also work to reduce the barriers that are keeping qualified professionals from entering the classroom by expanding alternative pathways to teacher certification - programs like Troops to Teachers, which helps former military personnel become classroom teachers; and Transition to Teaching, which provides training for people who want to become teachers and encourages states to develop and expand alternative routes to teacher licensure and certification.",NA,"506",NA
"Every teacher and every student deserves a safe classroom in which to work and learn.",NA,"506",NA
"The No Child Left Behind Act ensures that teachers and other school professionals can undertake reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in the classroom without the fear of litigation.",NA,"506",NA

"True Solutions for Affordable, High-Quality Health Care",NA,NA,NA
"The cost of providing health care for employees is a major burden for American businesses.",NA,"402",NA
"Health insurance costs for employers have been rising every year since 1996, causing businesses to hire fewer new employees and too many families to go without insurance.",NA,"402",NA
"Studies show that 60 percent of uninsured Americans either work for a small business or are dependent upon someone who does.",NA,"402",NA
"The way to alleviate that burden is to bring down the cost of health care in America.",NA,"402",NA
"Shifting the cost-burden onto the federal or state governments - costs that will ultimately be borne by the taxpayers - is not an effective solution to the problem.",NA,"402",NA
"We must attack the root causes of high health care costs by: aiding small businesses in offering health care to their employees; empowering the self-employed through access to affordable coverage; putting patients and doctors in charge of medical decisions; reducing junk lawsuits and limiting punitive damage awards that raise the cost of health care; and seizing the cost-saving and quality-enhancing potential of emerging health technologies.",NA,"402",NA
"It is also important that we reaffirm our Party's firm rejection of any measure aimed at making health care a government-run enterprise.",NA,"402",NA
"Association Health Plans (AHPs)",NA,NA,NA
"We support legislation to enable small employers to pool together to offer health insurance options to their employees.",NA,"402",NA
"The legislation, already passed by the House, gives small businesses the same purchasing power currently enjoyed by large employers and labor unions.",NA,"402",NA
"This will go a long way toward providing health care coverage for America's uninsured, 60 percent of whom are estimated to work for or be dependent on someone who works for a small business.",NA,"402",NA
"Medical Liability Reform",NA,NA,NA
"The medical liability system is harming our medical delivery system.",NA,"411",NA
"Doctors are afraid to practice medicine.",NA,"411",NA
"Frequent, unwarranted, lawsuits force doctors out of certain specialty areas and geographic regions.",NA,"411",NA
"The most dangerous result of this is the declining availability of emergency trauma care and women's health services.",NA,"411",NA
"In many cases, costs are so prohibitive that many obstetrics/gynecology practices are scaling back service or choosing not to practice altogether.",NA,"411",NA
"Junk lawsuits add at least $60 billion to health care costs in America because doctors are forced to practice defensive medicine, ordering extensive, unnecessary, and expensive tests and procedures to keep trial lawyers at bay.",NA,"411",NA
"The President has proposed, and the Republican House of Representatives has passed, reforms that would speed compensation to injured patients, reduce health care costs, and improve Americans' access to quality health care.",NA,"305",NA
"Shamefully driven by the powerful trial lawyer lobby, Democrat Senators have repeatedly thwarted the efforts of the Republican majority to deliver meaningful medical liability reform.",NA,"305",NA
"They have employed their obstructionist tactics three times in the current Congress alone.",NA,"305",NA
"The Republican Party reaffirms its commitment to putting patients and doctors ahead of trial lawyers.",NA,"305",NA
"We will continue to battle for litigation reforms that help keep doctors in practice, adopt reasonable caps on non-economic awards in medical malpractice suits, and ensure that Americans have access to quality affordable health care.",NA,"305",NA
"Health Information Technology",NA,NA,NA
"Estimates indicate that between 44,000 and 98,000 Americans die each year from medical errors, while as much as $300 billion is spent each year on health care that does not help patients - unnecessary, inappropriate, inefficient, or ineffective treatments.",NA,"411",NA
"This is absolutely unacceptable.",NA,"411",NA
"High costs, medical errors, administrative inefficiencies, and poor coordination are all closely connected to our failure to use health information technology as an integral part of medical care.",NA,"411",NA
"Republicans support President Bush's goal of ensuring that most Americans have electronic health records within the next 10 years.",NA,"411",NA
"He has requested funding for demonstration projects for broader adoption of health IT systems in communities and states.",NA,"411",NA
"Already, the use of health IT in the Veterans Administration has shown improvements in the quality of care and reductions in the cost.",NA,"411",NA
"The Administration is working with private sector innovators to develop reliable, secure methods of storing personal medical information that will broaden the benefits of health IT.",NA,"411",NA
"Privacy is paramount, and participation by patients will be voluntary.",NA,"411",NA
"These electronic health records will be designed to share information among and between health care providers only when authorized by a patient.",NA,"411",NA
"Advances at the nexus of science and technology raise serious moral and legal questions.",NA,"411",NA
"For example, although medical conditions have been linked to certain genetic markers, there is no certainty that many of these diseases will actually develop.",NA,"411",NA
"There is growing concern that employers and insurance companies will use genetic information to discriminate by denying jobs or insurance coverage to individuals who have predictive genetic markers for certain diseases.",NA,"411",NA
"We support efforts to enact genetic discrimination legislation that is fair, reasonable, and consistent with existing laws to prevent discrimination.",NA,"411",NA
"In addition, we must take action to allow doctors and hospitals to review best practices without fear of litigation.",NA,"411",NA

"In some states, activist judges are redefining the institution of marriage.",NA,"605",NA
"The Pledge of Allegiance has already been invalidated by the courts once, and the Supreme Court's ruling has left the Pledge in danger of being struck down again - not because the American people have rejected it and the values that it embodies, but because a handful of activist judges threaten to overturn commonsense and tradition.",NA,"605",NA

"People of good will disagree about whether America should have gone to war in Iraq, but this much is clear: this Administration badly exaggerated its case, particularly with respect to weapons of mass destruction and the connection between Saddam's government and al Qaeda.",NA,"305",NA
"This Administration did not build a true international coalition.",NA,"305",NA
"This Administration disdained the United Nations weapons inspection process and rushed to war without exhausting diplomatic alternatives.",NA,"305",NA
"Ignoring the advice of military leaders, this Administration did not send sufficient forces into Iraq to accomplish the mission.",NA,"305",NA
"And this Administration went into Iraq without a plan to win the peace.",NA,"305",NA
"Now this Administration has been forced to change course in order to correct this fundamental mistake.",NA,"305",NA
"They are now taking up the suggestions that many Democrats have been making for over a year.",NA,"305",NA
"And they must - because having gone to war, we cannot afford to fail at peace.",NA,"106",NA
"We cannot allow a failed state in Iraq that inevitably would become a haven for terrorists and a destabilizing force in the Middle East.",NA,"106",NA
"And we must secure more help from an international community that shares a huge stake in helping Iraq become a responsible member of that community, not a breeding ground for terror and intolerance.",NA,"107",NA
"As a first step, we must create a stable and secure environment in Iraq.",NA,"202",NA
"To do this right, we must truly internationalize both politically and militarily: we cannot depend on a US-only presence.",NA,"107",NA
"Other nations have a vital interest in the outcome, and we must bring them in to commit troops and resources.",NA,"107",NA
"The Bush Administration has missed three great opportunities to do that.",NA,"305",NA
"First, the President broke his promise to build a legitimate coalition in Iraq by exhausting diplomacy before resorting to the use of military force.",NA,"305",NA
"Second, when the statue fell in Baghdad, Kofi Annan invited the United States to come to the table to discuss international support - but we rejected his offer.",NA,"305",NA
"Third, when the President addressed the United Nations last fall, he once again refused to acknowledge the difficulties we faced in Iraq and failed to elicit support from other nations.",NA,"305",NA
"The President has not given our troops the clarity of mission, the equipment or the international support they need and deserve.",NA,"305",NA
"We have a different approach based on a simple commitment: Troops come first.",NA,"104",NA
"Our helicopter pilots have flown battlefield missions without the best anti-missile systems.",NA,"104",NA

"Too many of our nation's finest troops have died in attacks, because tens of thousands were deployed to Iraq without the best bulletproof vests, and there is a shortage of armored vehicles on the ground.",NA,"104",NA
"In a Democratic Administration, that will change.",NA,"104",NA
"Thousands of National Guardsmen and reservists have been forced to leave their families and jobs for more than a year - with no end in sight - because this Administration ignored the pressing need for a true coalition.",NA,"104",NA

"The rewards of respect are enormous.",NA,"101",NA
"We must convince NATO to take on a more significant role and contribute additional military forces.",NA,"101",NA
"As other countries, including Muslim majority countries, contribute troops, the United States will be able to reduce its military presence in Iraq, and we intend to do this when appropriate so that the military support needed by a sovereign Iraqi government will no longer be seen as the direct continuation of an American military presence.",NA,"105",NA
"Second, we need to create an international High Commissioner to serve as the senior international representative working with the Iraqi government.",NA,"107",NA
"This Commissioner should be backed by a newly broadened security coalition and charged with overseeing elections, assisting with drafting a constitution, and coordinating reconstruction.",NA,"107",NA
"The Commissioner should be highly regarded by the international community, have the credibility to talk to all the Iraqi people, and work directly with Iraq's interim government, the new U.S. Ambassador, and the international community.",NA,"107",NA
"At the same time, U.S. and international policies must take into consideration the best interests of the Iraqi people.",NA,"107",NA
"The Iraqi people desperately need financial and technical assistance that is not swallowed up by bureaucracy and no-bid contracts, but instead goes directly into grassroots organizations.",NA,"107",NA
"They need to see the tangible benefits of reconstruction: jobs, infrastructure, and services.",NA,"107",NA
"They should also receive the full benefits of their own oil production as quickly as possible, so as to rebuild their country and help themselves as individuals,",NA,"107",NA
"while also reducing the costs of security and reconstruction on the American taxpayer and the cost of gasoline to American consumers.",NA,"408",NA
"And they need to be able to communicate their concerns to international authorities without feeling they are being disrespected in their own country.",NA,"107",NA
"America also needs a massive training effort to build Iraqi security forces that can actually provide security for the Iraqi people.",NA,"107",NA

"To pick up the slack, we've called up our Guard and Reserves at historic levels.",NA,"305",NA
"Some have been on the ground in Iraq for as many as 15 months, much longer than was expected or promised.",NA,"305",NA
"Many of these units are being pushed to the limit and stretched far too thin.",NA,"305",NA
"The Administration's answer has just been to stretch further.",NA,"305",NA
"They have extended tours of duty, delayed retirements, and prevented enlisted personnel from leaving the service - effectively using a stop-loss policy and recall of Individual Ready Reserve members as a back-door draft.",NA,"305",NA
"We will add 40,000 new soldiers - not to increase the number of soldiers in Iraq, but to sustain our overseas deployments and prevent and prepare for other possible conflicts.",NA,"104",NA

"We will double the capacity of our Special Forces, the troops who took the fight to the Taliban with remarkable creativity after September 11th.",NA,"104",NA
"These troops conduct counter-terrorism operations, perform reconnaissance missions, and gather intelligence.",NA,"104",NA
"They also train local forces and build the relationships that are vital for our victory in the war on terror.",NA,"104",NA
"We will increase our civil affairs personnel - those who arrive on the scene after the major conflict ends to work with local leaders and officials to get the schools back in shape, the hospitals reopened, and the banks up and running.",NA,"104",NA
"We also need more military police, because public order is critical to establishing the conditions that allow peace to take hold.",NA,"106",NA
"State-of-the-art equipment.",NA,NA,NA

"We can't have a 21st century military unless we're using 21st century technology and preparing our forces for 21st century threats.",NA,"104",NA

"The best training.",NA,NA,NA
"Fourth, we must match our commitment to innovation with a commitment to the training, education, and facilities necessary to make the most of it.",NA,"104",NA
"Standing up for military families.",NA,NA,NA

"Better use of the National Guard.",NA,NA,NA
